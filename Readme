This is for Mainscript_3D_CRC.py

when you start to run a script, there will be a pop-up window to ask where to save the output images

Here are the lists of param
hyb_image_file : location of hyb image (one image with multiple z and multiple channels)
dapi_image_file : location of dapi image (one image with multiple z and multiple channels)
example:
hyb_image_file = "C:/Users/Nette/Desktop/3D_gaussian/hyb_00_CRC/hyb00_series12.tif"
dapi_image_file = "C:/Users/Nette/Desktop/3D_gaussian/hyb_00_CRC/DAPI_series12.tif"

n_stack: total of z stack in hyb image
n_channel: total of z stack in hyb image
This two params is to check the order of channel and stack which in ELS system mess them up

dapi_channel_number: the number of channel that dapi located, here is 1
channels_to_analyse: refer to gene in smFISH, 0 is highest wavelength, 1 is lower, 2 is lowest wavelength
example:
0 is cy7, 1 is cy5, 2 is AF594, and 3 is cy3

z_choose_list: what z do you want to show for 3D analysis ** minimum is 2 z **
example: list(range(3,6)) -> it will show z = 3,4,5

alpha: is opacity, 0 is transparent, 1 is opaque. This is used to adjust nicely to show the overlay image of dapi and hyb
example: alpha = 0.5


filter_param :[low cut, high cut] ** we did 3D frequency filter for 3D spot call outs)
example: [100,None] #[low cut, high cut]

threshold_mode : the theshold mode to find the spot. choose between rel (relative value) or abs (absolute value)
exmaple: threshold_mode = 'rel'

threshold : threshold cutoff of spots (between 0 to 1)

dpi : resolution for saved image
example: dpi =200

methods: choose between '3D' or 'planebyplane' ** now recomend 3D **

Output are
1. Individual z plane with the detected spots
2. All z plane with the detected spots
